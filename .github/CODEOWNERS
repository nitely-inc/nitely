# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @C-EO and @Nitely-Developers/core will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @C-EO @Nitely-Developers/core

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @C-EO and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
*.js    @C-EO

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository. In this example,
# the core team in the Nitely-Developers organization owns all .txt files.
